    <h2>Lyrics:</h2>
    <!-- First verse -->
    <p>Do you have the time
        To listen to me whine
        About nothing and everything all at once?
        I am one of those
        Melodramatic fools
        Neurotic to the bone, no doubt about it
        <br>
        Sometimes, I give myself the creeps
        Sometimes, my mind plays tricks on me

        It all keeps adding up
        I think I'm cracking up
        Am I just paranoid?
        Am I just stoned?

    <br>
        <!-- second verse - using br to separate -->
        And I went to a shrink
        To analyze my dreams
        She says it's lack of s*x that's bringing me down
        And I went to a wh*re
        He said my life's a bore
        So quit my whining 'cause it's bringing her down
        <br>
        Sometimes, I give myself the creeps
        Sometimes, my mind plays tricks on me

        It all keeps adding up
        I think I'm cracking up
        Am I just paranoid?
        Huh yeah, yeah, yeah (Ooh, ooh)

    <br>
        <!-- third verse - using br to separate -->
        Grasping to control
        So I better hold on
        <br>
        Sometimes, I give myself the creeps
        Sometimes, my mind plays tricks on me

        It all keeps adding up
        I think I'm cracking up
        Am I just paranoid?
        Am I just stoned?
    </p>
